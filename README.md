# This is the backend part of a game match app.

In this part of the project, I implement the server side of the application using NodeJS and ExpressJs, which consists ofÂ 

- CRUD functionalities on the games dataset,
- two customized endpoints "select_top_by_playtime" and "select_top_by_players".

# Additional used libraries/middlewares

- body-parser
- nodemon
- "cors"
